If it is alive, then destroying it would be murder. The burden that a life may create should always take a back seat to that life being give a CHANCE to exist. We have no problem saying that James E. Holmes murdered in the movie theater in Colorado. What if some of those people had become a burden on their family? Is it suddenly NOT murder any more?   Also, the difference between a fetus that can be destroyed in a 'Partial-birth"" abortion and a live baby that has full protection of the law is a distance of only a few inches down the birth canal. Killing it in the birth canal is the same as killing it in the womb.",692

Studies have shown that impairment while driving (while not encouraged ,and should have a limit, like alcohol. Keep in mind we didn't develop one before re-legalizing it in 1937.) Other studies show that cannabis going illegal at the same time alcohol became legal again was a gift to organized crime.  See, organized crime didn't exist the way it did (or at all) before alcohol prohibition. That literally changed the face of our nation. Marijuana and other drug prohibition changed everything as well. It (marijuana) is responsible for 70% of Drug Cartel income. We can end that with legalization.

From guns to blow dryers, etc. etc. This would make a more environmentally-friendly version.  Same with paper, our Constitution is written on hemp paper. George Washington smoked hemp, and grew it, even telling others to do it. Benjamin Franklin had a hemp paper mill. And news press. Hemp paper is the highest quality paper in the world. And completely renewable and eco-friendly. Industrial hemp can be grown en-mass with very little THC, making thieves unlikely. Plus it could be grown as a number one cash crop from Cali to Utah to Nebraska and most of the Bible-belt states.  Did I mention you can build the body for a car using hemp polymer? Even space shuttles and planes! Then you can fuel them using hemp-fuel that has ZERO carbon emissions.  ""Why isn't it legal if it's so great?"" You ask? Well, it's simple.

Sure it can benifet society in many ways but their are so many down sides to legalizing pot. If everyone were to become pot attics they would become more and more addicting up to the point that all they want to do is smoke pot. Allot of people are probably reading this and thinking that i am completly wrong, but the fact of the matter is that if you smoke pot long enough your mind will strictly be wrapped around trying to get high. With that said, how will our society progress if every has their minds on obtaining pot. Our world will not become more advanced because everyone who was one smart is now a pot head! Who will be the guy to cure cancer if everyone is on pot??",788

I hate how their's so many shows nowadays about how pot should be legalized or how theirs shows that show the medical pot stores in california and how pople hold rallies and riot to try and get pot legalized. I have smoked pot atleast 150+ times in my life(i haven't smoked pot in atleast 7+ months, and have only smoked it 4 times in the last 4 years), so i know what it's like to be high, and the only way i could see someone thinking that marijuanna is a medicine would be if your high when you say that. Their is no way that marijuanna could be a medicine. I hated the feeling of being high, and if you look up Cannabis and mental disorders, then you'll find that cannabis does more harm to you than good(the only reason people say it's good is because it numbs them and makes the pain go away).

I'm glad you brought up this subject.   In the history of mankind, prohibition of any substance that one puts into their own body has never worked.  Alcohol was no more or less popular during prohibition, than now. The only difference was that instead of States and the feds recieving tons of tax dollars, and the money from alcohol purchase going into the hands of legitimate businesses that employed citizens who contributed to society and paid taxes,  all the money was going to gangsters and thugs.  Well, the same thing is going on now. Marijuana was not made illegal until 1937. Before then the plant was taxed. It employed people. Now it is not taxed, and those who sell it are usually criminals of some sort (though many are harmless)  Still, the amount of marijuana consumed has not diminished one bit.  Cannabis has been used all through recorded history.   link    What makes us think that now, in the last 72 years something about the plant has changed.  Marijuana's illegal status is a historical farce. It's laughable, pointless, and counter productive.  1. Marijuana is a better pain killer, with less harmful side effects than any perscription drug. It costs less (0 if you have dirt and water already) and it's less addictive.  Are there harmful side effects of marijuana? Yes, but no more so than any other drug including alcohol, tobacco, or caffiene.   2. Taxes collected from the sale of marijuana would be in the hundreds of millions, it would give our economy an enourmous boost and employ potentially hundreds of thousands of people.  3. It would take the money from illegal drugs  out of  the hands of criminals.  4. It would be a huge relief on our overcrowded prisons, saving States hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, even millions in States with large prison populations like CA. Also, it would save the 18 year old A student and college hopeful from losing all his scholarships and having to check  YES  on every application that asks if they've ever been arrested, for the rest of his or her life, just because they had a tiny amount of a plant that is far safer than alcohol.  and by all means, come visit my blog sometime, www.crazydrugnews.blogspot.com.",2273

His ideas are consistent and rational. the're based on expanding wealth and diminishing most government powers that have put us here in the first place. People seem to act like government is so important that it's okay to allow it to choose winners and losers (as it has done through regulations and restrictions). Ron Paul and other Libertarian thinkers believe that individuals benefit the most when they have choice over what to do with their own property.   Reducing spending on social support, and taxation, increases inequality, and disproportionately affects the poor.   Is this why welfare reform resulted in economic prosperity? Is this why FDR almost made the Depression worse until the War started?  If there is any kind of spending that has ever helped economy and the prosperity of citizens it has historically been Military Spending. Yet that is one of the MANY things that government has boosted its spending in, and even so, just because military has been successful in the past doesn't mean that it's the only way.   Even so, helping those who truly can't help themselves is still a small portion of government spending.  edit: The Soviet Union had industrial progression, but this was also, technically, military spending. As for their agriculture, 27% of the food provided for the people was from private farm owners, even though they took up 1% of the total agricultural community of Russia.  Historically, as we see, overall wealth goes up with privatization, no with government welfare.  I agree that some welfare may still be necessary for those who need it most, but at the rate it is now (and how both Obama and Romney want to continue it) is not going to help increase the standard of living.",3308
