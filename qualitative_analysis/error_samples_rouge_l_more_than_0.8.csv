I never disputed this. I asked if, on your view, the retarded, senile, and comatose are all in the same boat as fetuses as none of them are self-aware and some are not feeling.   It is the woman's body.   It's a separate human life form inside the woman's body, but it in no way is a part of her body. In the same way a splinter is in my body but not a part of my body. The fetus is not an organ of the mother.   It is none of your business what another does with their body.   It is in the case of depriving someone else of their rights, like murder.   Only religious superstition.   I haven't once made a religious statement here. I've only given statements from biology.   One of the reasons your religion is so evil and dangerous when weilded by most of you, you cannot even see your own totalitarian views on morality should you be given enough power in any situation to control others, and you will literally make-up bullshit like your argument to justify it.   Cool red herring and ad hominem.   If god doesn't like it let him come tell people otherwise. Until then tell your fellow christians to stop with the abortion doctor death threats and scaring girls on their way to clinics.   Only if you actually answer the one question I've asked and stick with biology instead of emotion.   If god is all powerful he's killing more fetuses than every abortion doctor combined.

marijuana,3,ma396,And it is simply ludicrous for our already strained prison and court systems to have to process people for possession and distribution of a substance that is roughly equivalent to substances we accept.,And it is simply ludicrous for our already strained prison and court systems to have to process people for possession and distribution of a substance that is roughly equivalent to substances we accept.,1.0,Prohibition violates human rights.,Pro,"Yes. In comparison to those substances which we allow (alcohol and tobacco being the two most obvious) it is really no worse. It is far less potentially addictive than the other two, does not appear to have nearly as many physical ailments associated with it as tobacco or heavy alcohol use, and is much less likely to incite violence than alcohol. Some argue that this marijuana is a gateway drug. They forget that many people who use other drugs also began drinking first. The reason further drug experimentation is more likely to occur with pot use than with alcohol is not because pot ""leads one to search for a better high"" (otherwise we should expect similar results with alcohol, as it is more ""mellow"" than harder drugs) but is almost certainly because one is legal and the other is not. Legalization also increases the amount of information health agencies can get about its use and make it more likely for heavy users to get treatment. And it is simply ludicrous for our already strained prison and court systems to have to process people for possession and distribution of a substance that is roughly equivalent to substances we accept. And arguably the best point: we could stop using taxpayer money to crack down on dealers and instead tax pot sales via liscenced distributors.

According to the scientist David Geffen cigarette smokers may feel that their tobacco addiction is far less harmful than smoking an illegal drug such as marijuana. Marijuana smokers who abstain from tobacco sometimes boast that their drug of choice is safer than cigarettes. The truth is that both tobacco and marijuana have damaging effects.

marijuana,1,ma4,The Netherlands model shows that soft drugs can be legalized and it actually improves the society.,The Netherlands model shows that soft drugs can be legalized and it actually improves the society.,1.0,Does not cause any damage to our bodies.,Pro,"It should be legalized. We need to strive for a rational legal code. In relation to tobacco and alcohol, two of the legal drugs, cannabis is hands down the least harmful. It does not have the physically addictive properties of either alcohol or tobacco, cannabis users can stop anytime with withdrawal symptoms on par with or less than that of caffeine withdrawal. More than that, tens of thousands of people die every year from lung cancer and alcohol related accidents and illnesses. If your an alcoholic you can die if you just stop drinking. No one to my knowledge has ever been killed from smoking or quiting cannabis. In addition, cannabis has not been shown to have the carcinogenic effects that tobacco has. Cannabis has even been shown to promote new brain cell development, and its users report wide ranging benefits. The Netherlands model shows that soft drugs can be legalized and it actually improves the society. We need to end the propaganda and misinformation campaign, bring more reason and fairness to our legal code, and legalize cannabis.",1058
marijuana,3,ma136,Marijuana does not hurt anybody.,Marijuana does not hurt anybody.,1.0,Does not cause any damage to our bodies.,Pro,"Common sense does. Have you ever seen people do stupid things while under the influence of marijuana?   So in other words, you have no idea, but simply think that it would? Your ""common sense"" is based on assumption. And Common sense is often wrong for this reason.  Marijuana causes lethargy, which greatly decreases ""dangerous activities"". Someone who is high on Marijuana is not going to rob a bank, or steal a car, however there is a good chance they will sit on the couch and stare in amazement as a piece of lint floats by, or watch a movie about talking animals.   But for the sake of argument lets say it doesn't cause any harmful mind altering effects (which I'm sure you'll argue next).   Heavy long term usage can impair short-term memory, outside of that there really isn't any. Drinking bleach isn't all that good, yet it is not illegal.    Do you know of anyone who has been fired for marijuana use?   Not personally, no.   There's a lot of companies that would fire people for that even if it wasn't illegal.   SO???  A lot of companies will fire people for showing up late to work, should that be illegal?   When people don't have an income, they get desperate, especially when they want more money for their next fix. Desperate people do desperate (and often illegal) things.   {Laughs!}  Their ""fix""?  {Laughs some more}  Thank you for demonstrating you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. The sad thing is that a lot of people don't know why that's so funny. We aren't talking about heroine here, we're talking about weed. There's no such thing as a marijuana ""fix"". Marijuana is not addictive. People DONT go through marijuana withdraws, people can go through caffeine withdraws. Marijuana is less addictive than caffeine, which is why your statement that they ""need to get their fix"" is incredibly asinine. You obviously don't know anything about marijuana, which is funny because you want it to be illegal.  Let me further demonstrate why this statement is idiotic.  Desperate people, will sometimes do desperate (and often illegal) things, such as stealing a car....therefore we should outlaw cars. Following your logic.  Prohibition obviously doesn't work, which is why so many people still do marijuana, many people are sitting behind bars (costing taxpayer dollars) who should not be there in the first place. Marijuana does not hurt anybody.  I don't even like marijuana, but I can't think of a single good reason for it to be illegal.",2477
