So since you are pro-abortion....I assume you are pro-abortion since you do give the woman the right it is her body.....to kill it even after nine months.  Got one for ya. The woman is in scheduled for a csection in one week. She gets scared and decides that she does not want the baby. Is perfectly acceptable for her to kill it at nine months?  The woman took the risk that she might get pregnant. If she did not want a baby she should not have had sex, or done something to prevent it like sterilization.   And for your information the baby is not part of the mother. It has its own DNA, bodily systems, heart, circulatory system, fingerprints.

Bullshit. Try pricking a newborn with a needle and see if it has feelings, won't you?   But in the case of abortion, this right does not apply because it does not only pertain to the woman's body, but the body of another human being still attached to her.   No, you're wrong here. The fetus is considered a parasite. According to the OED, the scientific definition of a parasite is ""An animal or plant which lives in or upon another organism (technically called its host) and  draws its nutriment directly from it . Also extended to animals or plants that live as tenants of others, but not at their expense (strictly called commensal or symbiotic); also to those which depend on others in various ways for sustenance, as the cuckoo, the skua-gull, etc."" (Emphasis my own)  All a woman does to continue with the pregnancy is to allow the fetus to live within her and draw nutrients from her.

Laws are mutable...subject to change...and it varies...region to region...state to state...nation to nation.  Thus you cannot cite law to support an argument that is based on ethical considerations.  So yes if it pleases you let us assume I am Irish..or from a country that makes elective abortion illegal.

In other words, law is simply an auxiliary, convenient bit.   So Apples mate with other Apples then?....please your association is strained to say the least.   Apples provide seeds which are post-pollination. Besides that in biology there is asexual reproduction, which precludes the necessity for mating.   You cite various sources describing metabolic processes in fruit.  You are being disingenious..   No, I am acknowledging that apples are composed of living cells. Living cells take in and excrete waste.   We both know that Apples are not classified as living organisms...as they have the same genome in their cells that contain DNA as the tree or bush they are attached to...they are fruits...not organisms.   Plant cells are alive, by the standard definition. In theory you should be able to asexually propagate apple cells, too, and grow new trees. I have never done this, however, but as I understand it you convert the plant cell into a protoplast and place it in a regulated growth medium, like agar. The main difficulty I believe would be reversing the cellular differentiation so that the cell may show pluripotence.   Eat a fruit and you kill nothing.   Except millions of innocent plant cells. Who will defend them? They are defenseless! Oh the humanity of it all!   I shall cite a reference for you...   Apples are not fruit according to the purely strict definition you provided, they are accessory fruits.   You seem to be a bit confused about the differences between fruit and living multi cellular organisms with their own unique genome and conformity with the biological necessities to be declared living multicellular organisms.   You keep throwing around that word ""unique"" as if it is a prerequisite to life that it have a unique genome.

Pretending pro-life people care about scientific fact is bullshit. Not that it's impossible to be scientifically honest and still be pro-life, but so many outspoken pro-life people and groups who have no problem using misinformation, emotional blackmail, intimidation and deceit to manipulate people into doing what pro-life thinks is right. Pro-choice people don't have to lie, because they don't care if no one chooses an abortion as long as they aren't being lied to or bullied. In fact, I think you'd find most pro-choice people would agree that the fewer people need/want abortions, the better. But being dishonest or cruel is not the way to go about making that happen.   Why are D&E;illustrations so commonly used for pro-life propaganda when D&E;accounts for less than 5% of all procedures? Not because it's an honest representation of what most abortions look like, because it isn't. It's because it's supposed to be scarier and more guilt-inducing. If you show this picture to an average woman who is considering an abortion and tell her this is what her procedure will look like, you are probably lying to her.   (I'm not the one putting the semicolon after D&E;, the website is doing that.)   You want abortion legalâ¦on demand period.   You got it.    The fact is abortion is the act of KILLING A LIVING HUMAN BEING. THAT IS A SCIENTIFIC FACT. The heart starts beating around 22 daysâ¦..THAT IS A SCIENTIFIC FACT.   Please show me where I denied that a fetus is a human. Oh wait, I didn't, because I'm not an idiot. Of course a fetus is a human- did you expect me to claim it's a different species? The argument for abortion is sometimes concerned with  personhood , not the presence of homo sapien DNA and you're getting the two confused. But I think abortion would still be acceptable even if the government extended legal personhood to fetuses. One human should not use another human as a life support system unless the host is giving ongoing consent. This applies regardless of the age or legal status of either party or the relationship between the parties. If it's in your body and you don't want it there, you have a right to try to find someone who will take it out.

Or don't, because I already knew that. Maybe say some more obvious things.    Those who are pro-abortion of course would not like this pic   I'm fine with it. It's not pretty but it's a fairly realistic representation of an uncommon medical procedure. Medical procedures generally are not pretty. It's the use of it to scare women who won't even be getting this procedure that I have a problem with.   Most doctors try to save lives. And abortionists kill lives.   More obvious things!

gayRights,1,gr1,"all this time, those kids remain in the orphanage, when they could be in the hands of very loving, very caring, very responsible people who could give them a much better life, a much better education and much more to experience.","Here we have people that are begging to be parents and we're telling them ""you can't! we'd rather leave the kids in the orphanage than give them to you!""",0.1918,Gay parents can adopt and ensure a happy life for a baby.,Pro,"I've been reading the opposite side with a lot of interest and just like I expected, people have brought in a whole array of ""issues"" they have about homosexuality.   First I read about how the motives of the gay person are selfish   My response: WHO CARES? I see an old lady crossing the street. I help her cross over. Did I do it because I truly cared for her or did I do cause I wanted to feel good about myself? Does it matter? As long as I didn't help her because I wanted to steal her purse in the process then where is the harm???? So what if gays want to satisfy their parental instincts by caring for a child? How does that undermine the care and the love? Don't straight couples do the same? How many times have I heard straight couples saying that they will have children because that ""completes the family"", that they can't wait to be great mums or great dads. That's selfish too isn't it? But is it wrong? Hell no! I would be worried of someone didn't have that streak of selfishness in them. In my opinion, the people that make the best parents are the ones that wanted to be parents in the first place. Not just procreate, but BE PARENTS afterward. Here we have people that are begging to be parents and we're telling them ""you can't! we'd rather leave the kids in the orphanage than give them to you!""   Then it's about how it is unnatural for them to become parents because by definition they would be required to do something that is unnatural for them    Right, so, should we exclude all infertile individuals from the right to adopt?  Because the above argument basically implies that inability to conceive/procreate equals inability to perform as a parent, because nature didn't want you to become one in the first place. Isn't that ridiculous? The fact that we have children in foster care proves that the ability to conceive/procreate does not equal the ability to become a parent. So the two are clearly not cross linked.   Then it's about how it is no one's right to adopt because the only person that has authority over a child is the biological parent - only they can ""appoint"" someone to look after their child   Someone actually used the word ""property"", the child is the property of the biological parents and no institution should ever have the right bypass them and give the child to someone else.   Since when are human beings ""property""?  As a parent, all you have, is the responsibility to raise the child and provide for it. That's all you have. You don't posses a child. No one has possession of another human being, however young.   Now, I know for a fact that adoption agencies always look for people in the immediate or larger family that would foster the child. It's only when they have exhausted all those possibilities that the child is put up for adoption. In other words, no one in the family has offered to take over the responsibility! So it is then in the hands of the agency to find suitable parents from the general public. Let's be realistic, the family has absolved itself, or is not existent, or is mentally incapable. Now, I'm not saying everybody else then has the right to be their parent. But I think they do have the right to at least apply for the role, whether gay or straight.    But the child is going to be bullied!   Well, is that really an argument? If the kid is going to be bullied that's because the parents of the other children are bigoted and they have instilled that bigotry on their bully-kid. Kids are bullied everyday for being black, Muslim, Asian, tall, short, ginger etc etc. Does that mean we should take them away from their black, Muslim or ginger parents?   The reality is, these kids are spending their life in an orphanage. I find it funny how people who are otherwise unwilling to adopt them, think that they have the right to obstruct others who do. And they justify it with an array of bigoted crap. And all this time, those kids remain in the orphanage, when they could be in the hands of very loving, very caring, very responsible people who could give them a much better life, a much better education and much more to experience.",4119

gayRights,3,gr293,How does any gay getting married effect any straight couple?,"All gays want is equality, and if the government stopped using the word marriage but instead used civil unions that would be  great",0.0606,Gay marriage is like any other marriage.,Pro,"Force themselves into a club where there not wanted?  How does any gay getting married effect any straight couple? Your argument, which you continue to repeat time and time again, is ridiculous, and you know it.  All gays want is equality, and if the government stopped using the word marriage but instead used civil unions that would be  great . Look at this  site  that advocates equal marriage rights. It gives a number of scenarios:   We want the Flag of Equal Marriage to be complete, with all 50 stars lit up. We see three routes to marriage equality, as we define it:  1. Every individual state could pass a law allowing same-sex marriage.  2. The federal government could repeal the Defense of Marriage Act and allow same-sex marriage at the federal level, overriding all state-level bans.  3. The term ""marriage"" could be removed from state and/or federal laws, turning all ""marriages"" into civil unions in the eyes of the government. PLUS, same-sex civil unions would need to be recognized in all 50 states or at the federal level.   So here you're arguing a straw man ""gays aren't being reasonable"" argument.  Back to the whole ""joining a club thing"" and why it's bullshit. When African-Americans and other minorities ""forced"" their way into predominately white institutions, and clearly weren't wanted, should they have stopped?  In addition, marriage isn't a club. There aren't members only meetings where only married people are allowed to get into, and married people don't have to do anything for other married couples. Marriage is the legal (and often religious/cultural) union of two people who love each other and intend to spend the rest of their lives together. So allow me to repeat: how does letting gays marry affect, even a little bit, straight married couples? What gives them the right to deny those who want to pursue happiness with the one they love, legal sanction to do so?  If this is the best argument that you can come up with for opposing gay marriage, maybe you need to reevaluate your position and realize how ridiculous you sound (even more so than usual).",2094

There will be (HOPEFULLY!) a vast majority of people who don't smoke, if and when marijuana becomes legalized. Just because a lot of people drink doesn't mean everyone does.

Just to make you happy, I don't really like Obama that much, he's failed in a lot of aspects that I thought he'd do better, drones in Pakistan and others, hasn't pushed Republicans far enough to help the economy, and hasn't done shit to stop everything with Iran. I also remember watching a 2008 video of him speaking for ending the war on weed, yet it's only gotten worse, from what I've heard. I just don't like people calling him the devil, because he isn't.   Money isn't spent on less taxing. that just means there is less money to spend.   Debt is created by a deficit. Less taxing means more debt.   And increased welfare spending is not the answer, as LBJ and Nixon have shown. Instead, proposals by Bill Clinton, JFK, and Reagan have gotten more people off of government dependence and more independent, as well as leaving room for the private sector to increase wealth for all Americans (as it historically does).   Increased welfare spending was mandatory, it takes years to change the systems, and as far as I'm aware, it largely falls outside of his mandate (state law, not federal, I'd assume?).

As I've said before, I like this part of them, but disagree with others.

False   Whilst I agree that there was a large extent of government failure after deregulation, were there not deregulation in the first place, there would not have been the opportunity for CBO's, the abuse of the housing market, and the reckless behaviour that you described. You wish to completely deregulate the banks? This seems unwise, bankers operate in their own self interest, not in that of the bank, and not in that of the country. Remember that the heads of banks who brought about the recession got hundreds of millions of dollars, that sort of behaviour would only become more common, with people not being held responsible for their actions.   Based on the assertions of Catholic Bishops?   I was simply using them as an example. I have many complaints of Republican behaviour, and I can only imagine that this budget is just more of the same.",2564
