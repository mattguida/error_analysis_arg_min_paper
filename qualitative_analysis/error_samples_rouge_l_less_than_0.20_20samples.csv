So many liberals out there try to paint this idealistic picture that you can make stupid decisions without any real consequences, but that's simply not true. When you have unprotected sex, a baby is conceived. At that moment, whether the baby has a pumping heart or not, it becomes a mother's natural and personal responsibility to do what is best for the baby. That could mean one of many options, such as raising the baby yourself, putting it up for adoption, or any number of alternatives. But I will tell you, as basic human decency should tell you, that anyone arguing that the termination of that baby is what's best for the baby is wrong in the most perverse way conceivable.   You chose to act irresponsibly. Now you must face the consequences, and just because you don't want to does NOT give you the right to terminate the existence of a potential human being.  Now, of course there are cases of rape and/or incest conceptions. In these cases, I do not feel that the mother should be forced to carry a child she does not deserve to have. She did nothing wrong, and should not be forced to carry the offspring of her rapist. But at the same time, I still believe that life begins at conceptions, and at that point it become a moral judgment for the mother to make. Do you believe in giving life to another human being, filling it with opportunity to make a name for himself or herself, or do you believe that you'd like to deliver children following consensual and natural intercourse between a man and a woman? At that point, the government should have nothing to do at all with the mother's say; she is no longer the irresponsible one, but rather the victim of a gruesome and despicable crime.",1863

abortion,3,ab439,"If it is alive, then destroying it would be murder.",,0.0,Abortion kills a life.,Con,"Abortion can only come down to one question: Is the fetus alive or not. If it is alive, then destroying it would be murder. The burden that a life may create should always take a back seat to that life being give a CHANCE to exist. We have no problem saying that James E. Holmes murdered in the movie theater in Colorado. What if some of those people had become a burden on their family? Is it suddenly NOT murder any more?   Also, the difference between a fetus that can be destroyed in a 'Partial-birth"" abortion and a live baby that has full protection of the law is a distance of only a few inches down the birth canal. Killing it in the birth canal is the same as killing it in the womb.",692
abortion,2,ab255,"most late-term abortions amount to clear infanticide, as the baby is actually living outside of the womb before it is killed.","At some point, the living thing inside a woman's womb becomes a human being.",0.1622,Abortion kills a life.,Con,"I am so on the basis of Natural Rights. At some point, the living thing inside a woman's womb becomes a human being. I do not believe this to be at conception, and I cannot define exactly when that point is. But it is fairly clear to me that it is not one instant before birth. My daughter was born six weeks premature. If she had not been premature, would it have been legitimate to abort her two weeks later? Would it be legitimate for a woman to delay labor via drugs and have her baby aborted past the time it was actually due? And finally, most late-term abortions amount to clear infanticide, as the baby is actually living outside of the womb before it is killed. Must I accept this in order to be ""pro-choice"" in your eyes? Must I oppose a first-trimester abortion of a rape or incest victim in order to be ""pro-life""?  You make the argument that ""pro-life"" people should be for legal abortion, since legal abortion leads to fewer abortions and deaths of mothers having abortions. I question these data. Most of the countries where abortion is illegal are poorer and have other problems -- it is thus hard to isolate the effect of abortion laws on abortion rates.  But, for the sake of argument, let's say you are right: Would this then also justify any other crime? What if the legalization of murdering one person a year was demonstrated to reduce the total number of violent crimes -- could it be justified? You are using utilitarian ethics, whereas many non-religious and some religious abortion opponents use Natural Rights ethics. Utilitarianism allows for any abrogation of rights if it can be seen as being ""in the common good,"" whereas Natural Rights allow for no such abrogations. There is nothing hypocritical about being a Natural Rights-based opponent of abortion.",1785

I saw an awful interview with a woman who ""survived abortion"" during the seventh month of her mothers pregnancy.

If a baby cannot survive outside the womb, or outside of an artificial womb known as an incubator, there is nothing morally or ethically wrong about aborting that said baby. A child changes the lives of many people involved. If that child cannot be brought into a life of happiness and a healthy, stable environment- they really don't need to be brought into the world at all. We're there medically.

You could still have society without marriage. And even if that weren't true, expanding the legal definition of marriage to allow for gays would not be a radical change. More akin to changing the texture of the bricks.   doesn't sound like toleration or freedom. It sounds more like tyranny.   Was enforcing racial integration tyranny? No. There are times when tolerance is justified and times when it is not.   You assume that racial integration and gay marriage are morally equivalent.   No, I don't. But I think there are important similarities. Both skin color and sexual orientation are things that are part of ones identity. They cannot be changed. Neither makes a person inferior. Discrimination on the basis of either is logically unsound.   Please tell me how judging the color of ones skin is equivalent to judging the behavior of someone.   Again they are not the same, just similar. But saying homosexuality is a behavior is being intentionally misleading. It's like saying shouting is ""just a behavior"" and therefore people should repress their anger at all times. It's completely impractical and utterly disconnected from reality.   You wouldn't say it's a good thing?   I was referring to homosexuality, not gay marriage. Being gay is neither good nor bad, it's neutral. Gay marriage, on the other hand,  is good , because it shows acceptance of behavior for which we should be showing acceptance.   Yes, just like thieves and murderers should repress their desires for their entire lives.   Oh, wow, that's a pretty hardcore view. How is homosexuality anywhere near as bad as theft or murder? All I see is two people having sex. No harm done.   Some behaviors are detrimental to civilization and should be restrained for the greater good.   Agreed. But gay sex is not one of them.   Just ask the Roman Empire what happens when you let homosexuality be freely expressed.   Hahaha. You're a funny guy.   Telling people the are born gay and can't change kills hope for someones who's conscience is troubled.   Well, they  are  born gay and they  can't  change, so that's just telling them the truth. Why should their conscience be troubled? That would only make sense if they bought into all that Christian nonsense.   ...waving the magic wand of neutrality...   You wouldn't take seriously a pamphlet from Neo-Nazis about how Jews are inferior people would you? Do you not understand the importance of neutrality?   Homosexuality is a behavior, we don't choose our behaviors therefore you can't be free from bad behaviors.    Homosexuality is not a behavior, it's a sexual orientation. Gay sex is the behavior. We can and should repress bad behaviors, but gay sex is not a behavior bad enough to warrant repression.   you...deny the moral component in play and therefore deny the existence of a moral agent (a soul)   Morality does not come from anything supernatural.

If you've never smoked it, it's hard to describe how it makes you feel. The best way I can put it is that it relaxes you enough for you to notice the world around you. It slows the momentum of life so that you are more aware of your environment. This leads me to my next part. It's going to require a leap, so follow me. The only function of our government is to maintain a robust economy. Most everything can be understood under this one assumption. The main goal of our government is to keep us preoccupied, to keep us serving the economy by producing and consuming. Our government is a client of corporations. It's another tool that large businesses use to reach their goals. They invest in government like they invest in a business venture, with the expectation that it will make them more money.   A requirement of this ever churning, ever expanding economy is the passivity of its participants' inquiries and the maintenance of their blind actions. This brings me to my conclusion. When you smoke marijuana, you start to think more about the requirements of your brain and your mind (What do I truly NEED?) You start to ask questions like, ""Do I really need that many THINGS?"", ""Is it natural to be obligated to a flourescently lit office building for 40 hrs every week of your life to basically move paper from one place to another, to be treated like a child whose time is monitored, and reprimanded by a ""boss""?"" ""Do I get meaning from my life or am I just a cog in the wheel of this economy, eg. is it essential for the universe to contain operating services clerical specialists?"" ""Why can't I grow a plant in my backyard, but I can be on numerous synthetic prescription medications?""
