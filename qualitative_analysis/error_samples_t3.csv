gm,0,18arg1,5,1,FN,Gay couples can declare their union without resort to marriage,Con,Different people have different thoughts about what marriage is.  Should a christian give up their right to their beliefs about what marriage is so that homosexuals will feel included? Homosexuals should have rights as domestic partners because a marriage between people of the same sex is not the same as a marriage between two people of opposite sexes.,354,0
gm,0,7arg1,5,1,FN,Gay couples can declare their union without resort to marriage,Con,"Absolutely No. Who are we to rewrite the creator of this world's view on what marriage is? They deserve the civil union and employment security laws, but rewriting the definition of marriage is going too far!",208,0
gm,0,173arg7,5,1,FN,Marriage should be between a man and a woman,Con,"You will never change people's minds about the legitimacy of homosexuality and other sexual variations. These are strict taboos , especially that of male homosexuality, and have been since time out of mind - rightly or wrongly. Most people cannot even discuss this with you because the subject is so distasteful . Marriage came about before religion. It grew and developed within religion. Most  religions do not accept - cannot accept - anything other than heterosexuality. Thousands of cartoons, insults and jibes will not force people to change their minds about these taboos. In this country we've moved at least a 500 years in the last 30 years in our consciousness because of your dogged determination. People are now sensitized to the concept of alternate sexualities and the right of all people to be happy being themselves. But marriage?  Many people cannot wrap their minds around what you are suggesting. .  I propose that ALL unions in the US be termed civil unions. A national mandate, not state by state. Any two adults should be able to unite whether for love, for, sex, for financial stability or for fun. Let the government move out of 'the marriage business.'",1177,0
gm,0,60arg2,5,1,FN,Gay couples should be able to take advantage of the fiscal and legal benefits of marriage,Pro,"I do believe that if you love each other that you should be together, man/woman or man/man, woman/woman.  Of course you have the right to be together. But marriage is a religious thing, and religion frowns upon gay people, and the law was interpreted by the bible, meaning changing the law means changing such interpretations.  I just wonder if you want to get married to prove that you love each other or just to rake in the benefits of being married (I bet its either the love one or both)  So maybe they should change the law to give gay couples the benefits of being married without actually being married  But again gay people should have the right to be with and love each other.   (sorry if this sounds bashing or anything I don't want to offend)",753,0
gm,0,117arg1,5,1,FN,Gay couples can declare their union without resort to marriage,Con,"No one can dictate who one loves. That is not the governments job, nor is the job of anyone else. However, marriage has long been deemed as a relationship between a man and a woman. This is my personal belief. Gay couples should have the ability to be together, yes, and should be given equal rights as this is what this country was founded on. But marriage is between one man and one woman.",391,0
gm,0,78arg1,5,1,FN,Gay couples can declare their union without resort to marriage,Con,"I'm con because gay marriage is against the moral rights. I will never agreed with the fact that gay couples adopting children, that is just wrong because those  children will not have the same childhood as normal kids. How about when they go to school and the teacher ask who are the parents he will be like oh! I got two moms or I got two dads. That its just not right because it has always been Adam and Eve not Adam and Steve. The bible does not says that men should marry men or vice versa. It has always been clear to me that the word Marriage it's between Man and Woman. Gay couples can live their crazy and in moral life however they want but will not be allowed to get marry like a heterosexual couple. It is just disgusting seen a man kissing other man or a woman kissing other woman if front children. They should keep themselves in secret.",851,0
gm,0,148arg1,5,1,FN,Gay couples can declare their union without resort to marriage,Con,"The ideal setting in which to raise a child is with a Mother and a Father. The human genome has been mapped and no gay gene was found. Any reputable biologist, psychologist, et al., will tell you there are variety of reasons why people engage in homosexual behavior. Homosexuals shouldn't be absued, demeaned, etc. However, most homosexuals do not actually want to get married. There are already many benefits afforded to homosexuals (domestic partnership benefits, they're allowed to enter into contracts, etc.). It appears that the real reason this is being pushed as some urgent civil right is not because of a real need or desire, but a desire to elevate homosexual behavior with that of (universally accepted) male and female union. Children deserve to be raised in healthy environments. People deserve to hear the truth about the unhealthy effects (physcial and emotional) of homosexual behavior. Lastly, God does exist, His Word is true and if this nation or any other turns its back on Him, we are doomed (whether any of you like it, believe it, or want to believe it). Thank you for reading this. Thank God for the freedom to say what we believe. If you don't agree with me on this, let's agree that's great that we can say what we think",1246,0
gm,0,164arg4,5,1,FN,It is discriminatory to refuse gay couples the right to marry,Pro,"Well'if we start legalizing gay marriage,that would be one step forward to integrating them into mainstream society.It would lead to less discrimination against them and to view them as natural. Well, that is exactly what would be wrong with this.  We tell our children that it is right to be gay,that most certainly shatters the pillars of society anywhere and everywhere.And let us also consider the repercussions-I live in India,where there was little to no of this stuff until a few years ago.Now, thanks to the pretentious tolerance that the west is showing,gay culture is booming out here as well.  Yet it does not have as much momentum as in the west,simply because of social stigma (which is essential,and extremely low divorce rates are a proof). It may not be anyone's business who a man sleeps with in the privacy of his home,but viewing it as natural or normal will destroy how we view ourselves in context to others.Next time a child goes to his locker room,you cannot be sure what he is going to face or feel.  10 year olds having a sleepover can perceive this as normal,then there is no telling where we can end up. Change for the sake of change is unnecessary and dangerous...",1192,0
ugip,0,414721990arg5,5,1,FN,Implies ultimate power on the part of the state,Con,"The phrase 'under God' acts as a limit on what is otherwise an unlimited promise of allegiance to a state. Without 'under God' the pledge becomes a promise to support whatever the current policies of the government are. With 'under God' included, I can comfortably recite the pledge knowing that when the government adopts some policy that is contrary to the 'Laws of Nature and of Nature's God' I can reject the policy without breaking my promise. Unlimited allegiance to a state is not a good thing, as the historic examples of World War II show us. The United States is not guiltless on this score either. In my own life the government has carried laws on the books that were unfair to blacks, to women, to the native inhabitants of this continent. Our current policy on interrogation by torture of supposed enemy combatants seems to be another example. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The greatest danger to the exercise of any freedom, religious or otherwise, is the unchecked power of the organized state. The phrase 'under God' acts as a check on that authority. It is a little reminder to those who might tend to abuse their position that I will not blindly act based on state dictates but will apply other standards when deciding my own actions.",1242,0
ugip,0,414721839arg4,5,1,FN,Likely to be seen as a state sanctioned condemnation of religion,Pro,I do believe that under God should be left in the US Pledge of Allegiance.  Our Country was founded by those that wanted the freedom to worship God in what ever way that they wanted to with out be persecuted.  Those that did not believe were also left alone.  This great country was a garden for those that came here and we need to keep that way less we turn our nation into a desert like the middle east.,405,0
ugip,0,414721866arg1,5,1,FN,Separation of state and religion,Con,"Theocracy is in our midst---7.US churches have been tax-exempt for over 200 years, yet there are no signs that America has become a theocracy.(Hello?) If the tax exemption were a serious threat to the separation of church and state, the US government would have succumbed to religious rule long ago. (More reason for Churches and Church Related organizations to be penalized for raising funds and waging campaigns with Civil outcomes) As the Supreme Court ruled in Walz v. Tax Commission of the City of New York (1970), freedom from taxation for two centuries has not led to an established church or religion, and, on the contrary, has helped to guarantee the free exercise of all forms of religious belief. [18]How about Spiritual but non-Religious beliefs Sir?) The Holy Roman Ctholic Church (Official name of Corporation) distances itself from its Priesthood by making clergy Contractors, not paying Social Security for them, making them pay income taxes and including as Income living in the Rectory where they are forced to reside.",1036,0
ugip,0,414721951arg1,5,1,FN,Separation of state and religion,Con,"Since it is a governmental thing, then no.  I'm OK with it being there, though.  It's a bit of a trivial matter.  Where does NBC get of censoring what was supposed to be a newscast?",181,0
ugip,0,414721831arg6,5,1,FN,America is based on democracy and the pledge should reflect the belief of the American majority.,Pro,"Religious bondage shackles and debilitates the mind and unfits it for every noble enterprise. - James Madison   Genius that statement was written in refrence to a tyrant that would have forced you to say under God on pain of DEATH! And the simple yet increadibly important thing that all you Cons seem to be forgetting is that NO ONE IS FORCING YOU TO SAY OR BELIEVE ANYTHING YOU DONT WANT TO!!!! Since it was added 58 Years ago no one has been forced to believe in God, or put to death for not believing in the Almighty, nor has anyone been incarcerated for not saying those words in the pledge so quit all your meaningless bitching about how your looking for attention and want everyone to look at you, cause we both know thats what all of this is really and truely about. When we get down to the core you all just want to have everyones attention while you create problems for 89% of the country! I'll say it again for the slow ones that are a little behind, NO....ONE....IS....FORCING....YOU....TO....BELIEVE....IN....GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1040,0
ugip,0,414721684arg3,5,1,FN,Under God  is part of American tradition and history,Pro,"As a general proposition, government should be God neutral.

ugip,0,414721924arg2,1,5,FN,Removing under god would promote religious tolerance,Con,"Instead of taking out 'under god,' ADD, 'or not' which gives us 'UNDER GOD OR NOT.' This way their god is in The Pledge so they can't complain of discrimination, we atheists are in there, and children are being taught about choice of belief, inclusion, and tolerance! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;'I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God or not, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.'",470,0

We are a Nation under God. WE are a Nation that has a Freedom of Religion. Everyone gets so offended by Merry Christmas and 'under God'. People get so offended by something that's not offensive. We can't say Merry Christmas because it offended people, now they want to take away 'under God'. What will we have left? Freedom of Religion, it applies to Christians too you know.",466,0
